  `I believe whatever doesn’t kill you, simply makes you…stranger.`,
  `The truth is a matter of circumstances, it’s not all things to all people all the time.`,
  `When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it, always.`,
